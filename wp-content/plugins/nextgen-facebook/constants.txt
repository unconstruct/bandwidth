PHP Constants for NextGEN Facebook Open Graph

To address very specific needs, some PHP constants for NGFB may be defined in
your wp-config.php or template files (generally before the wp_head() function
call). 

NGFB_DEBUG

	Set this constant to 'true' to turn on hidden debug messages, and use
	"View Source" on any webpage to view the debug messages. An
	informational message box will also be displayed in admin pages as
	reminder that debug mode is on.

NGFB_DEBUG_OBJ_EXP

	Cache object expiration time in seconds when debug mode is enabled
	(defaults is 3 seconds).

	Cache file expiration time in seconds when debug mode is enabled
	(defaults is 5 seconds).

NGFB_WP_DEBUG

	Send debug messages to PHP's error_log() as well.

NGFB_RESET

	Set this contant to 'true' to reset all options to their defaults when
	the plugin is activated.

NGFB_OPEN_GRAPH_DISABLE

	Set this contant to 'true' to prevent the plugin from adding Open
	Graph meta tags in the webpage head section. See "Disable Open Graph
	Meta Tags" above for an example of it's use.

NGFB_MIN_IMG_SIZE_DISABLE

	Set this contant to 'true' to disable the minimum width and height
	checks for the <img/> attributes in the content. All images, no matter

	NGFB ignore the <img/> HTML tags in my content?" on the FAQ page
	for additional information.

NGFB_MIN_DESC_LEN

	The minimum allowed description length value. The default is 160. A
	maximum description length value is configurable on the settings page,
	but any value entered bellow NGFB_MIN_DESC_LEN will be changed to

	Disable all use of PHP's curl functions (all NGFB file caching
	features will be disabled).

NGFB_CURL_USERAGENT

	Used by the remote content caching feature for social button images
	and JavaScript. The Google+ JavaScript is different for (what Google
	considers) invalid user agents. Since crawlers and robots might
	refresh the cached files, the NGFB_CURL_USERAGENT defines a default
	user agent string. You may define a NGFB_CURL_USERAGENT constant in
	your wp-config.php file to change the default NGFB uses.

NGFB_CURL_CAINFO

	When the "Verify SSL Certificates" option is checked, PHP's curl
	function needs a certificate authority file. Define the

	default location used by NGFB.

NGFB_WISTIA_API_PWD

	In order to share embedded videos from Wistia, you must define your
	Wistia API password (see the Account Dashboard -> API Settings on
	Wistia).
