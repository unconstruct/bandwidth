NPR Digital Services Wordpress plugin for the NPR API.

V1.1 - Release Notes
   - This version will allow admins to configure their Wordpress site to retrieve multiple NPR API query returns to be automatically published to their blog on an hourly cron basis.  From the Admin -> Settings -> NPR API Get Multi page (wp-admin/options-general.php?page=ds_npr_api_get_multi_settings) an admin can add a number of queries they would like to query the API with.  These query entries can contain an API ID for a single story, or an aggregate.  The query can also contain the full query string can be created from the NPR API Query Generator (http://www.npr.org/api/queryGenerator.php).  You can also enter the URL for a story you found on npr.org.  The entered queries will be executed via the Wordpress cron functionality, hourly.  Any new stories that are available will be automatically published.  You can find a list of aggregates at the npr.org's API documentation page (http://www.npr.org/api/inputReference.php).

  - Stories retrieved from the NPR API will be created as Posts in Word Press.  Each post will have a number of meta fields associated with the post.  These meta fields will all begin with 'npr_' and can be viewed on a post edit screen with Custom Fields option enabled through Screen Options.  A story from the API that has a primary image defined will have that image set as the featured image of the Wordpress Post.  Any bylines for the NPR Story will be stored in the meta field npr_byline.
	The list of npr_ meta fields is:
		- npr_api_link
		- npr_byline
		- npr_html_link
		- npr_last_modified_date
		- npr_pub_date
		- npr_retrieved_story
		- npr_story_content
		- npr_story_id

- On the All Posts admin screen we've made a couple of modification/additions to help you manage your NPR API content.  
	- There is a new Bulk Action available, 'Update NPR Story'.  When one or many NPR API Stories are selected and the Update 
	  NPR Story action is applied, the plugin will re-query the NPR API for those stories, and if the story's content has changed the plugin
	  will update the post in Wordpress.
	- There is also a new column added to this page titled "Update Story".  For any Post retrieved from the NPR API there will be a link 
	  to "Update" the story.   Pressing this link will bring the user to the query NPR API page with the story ID pre-filled.  Pressing 
	  "Publish" on this screen will re-query the NPR API for the story and update the Post with any changes that may have taken place
	  on the NPR API for that story.

- Update and Delete of pushed stories.  
	A story that was written in your Wordpress site and pushed to the NPR API will be automatically be updated in the API when your story is updated in Wordpress.  When your Post is moved to the Trash in Wordpress, your story will be deleted from the NPR API.  If a Trashed Post is resorted, your story will be made available from the NPR API again.

V1.0 - 
- As not a lot of users have installed the V1.0 of the NPR API Plugin, there are a couple of things to keep in mind.
	- On the NPR API settings page (wp-admin/options-general.php?page=ds_npr_api) there are 4 fields.
		- API KEY - This is your NPR API Key that you can get from NPR.  If you wish to ingest your stories to the NPR API you'll 
		  need to have your keep configured by NPR Digital Services.  Please contact Digital Services with a support request
		  at http://info.ds.npr.org//support.html,
		- Pull URL - This is the root url for retrieving stories.  For testing purposes, you should configure this to be http://api-s1.npr.org.  
		  NOTE : this url should not contain an ending slash.
		- Push URL - Much like the pull url, this url is used to pushing stories to the NPR API.  Again, for testing purposes, you can
		  utilize NPR's staging servers available at http://api-s1.npr.org.  If you do not wish to ingest your content, or your NPR API 
		  has not been authorized, you should leave this field empty and the WP plugin will not attempt to push you content to the 
		  NPR API.
		- Org ID - This is your organizations ID assigned by NPR.  If you don't know your Org ID, please contact Digital Services at:
		  http://info.ds.npr.org//support.html.
	- You can pull stories one at a time from the NPR API by using the Get NPR Stories page under admin Posts menu
	   (wp-admin/edit.php?page=get-npr-stories).  This can enter a story ID from the API, or the URL for the story from npr.org.  There are
	  number of aggregates that you can use, such as ID=1001 is Top News, or the show "All Things Considered" is ID=37.  For help in 
	  finding possible query options, please see the Query Generator http://www.npr.org/api/queryGenerator.php and documentation 
	  (http://www.npr.org/api/inputReference.php) at npr.org.
